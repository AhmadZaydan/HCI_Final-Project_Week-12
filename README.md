Project description:
In order to fulfil our assignment for the final project of Human and Computer Interaction course, we made a web app that lets user adopt and put animal for adoption from their home. We call it Homepaw. Just like it’s purpose, it enables user to be able to search their preferred animal and adopt them, and lets people put an animal in their possession for adoption so that they can be adopted by someone else.

Main problem:
We noticed that it’s not that easy for some people to get a pet nowadays. The most common way for people to get a pet is to go to an animal shelter or pet store. But for some people who are too busy, it would be a problem to get themself a pet. 

Our solution:
Homepaw is a website that enables people to get a pet and to put their own pet for adoption. Without needing to leave their house. They can do it from anywhere at anytime.

External library used:
  1. Font awesome
  2. Bootstrap
